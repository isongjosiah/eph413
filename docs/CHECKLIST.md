Of course. A detailed, actionable checklist is the best way to structure a complex, high-impact research project. Here is the PhD-level study plan broken down into a comprehensive checklist, designed to guide your work from foundational experiments to the final publication.

### **PhD Research Plan Checklist: Agentic Federated Learning for Equitable Genomics**

This checklist outlines the two primary stages of the research: (I) a rigorous demonstration of the problem with existing methods, and (II) the implementation and validation of the proposed FedGene framework as the solution.

#### **Part I: Foundational Study — Demonstrating the Insufficiency of Standard FL for Genomic Data (Months 1-8)**

**Objective:** To produce definitive, publishable evidence that standard federated learning algorithms are inadequate for handling the unique, structured, and confounding heterogeneity present in genomic data.

**Phase 1: Principled Simulation of Heterogeneity Scenarios**

*   **1.1. Establish "Standard Non-IID" Universe (Universe A):**
    
    *   - [ ] Select benchmark dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10).
        
    *   - [ ] Implement data partitioning using a Dirichlet distribution to simulate severe label distribution skew.1
        
    *   - [ ] Configure federation with 100 clients.
        
*   **1.2. Establish "Genomic Non-IID" Universe (Universe B):**
    
    *   **structured feature skew**.
        
    *   - [ ] Simulate a binary disease phenotype based on a small set of truly causal SNPs.
        
    *   - [ ] Critically, introduce a **confounding factor** by correlating baseline disease risk with ancestry.
        
    *   - [ ] Distribute the simulated population across ~10 clients to mimic real-world data silos (e.g., some clients are ancestrally homogeneous, others are admixed).
        

**Phase 2: Rigorous Comparative Evaluation**

*   **2.1. Implement Canonical FL Algorithms:**
    
    *   - [ ] Baseline: FedAvg.5
        
    *   - [ ] Robust Aggregation: FedProx.6
        
    *   - [ ] Architectural Personalization: FedRep.6
        
    *   - [ ] Normalization-based Personalization: FedBN.
        
    *   - [ ] Clustering-based: A representative Clustered FL algorithm.8
        
*   **2.2. Define and Implement Evaluation Metrics:**
    
    *   - [ ] **Standard Metrics:** Global & personalized model accuracy (AUC), fairness (standard deviation of accuracy across clients), and convergence speed.9
        
    *   - [ ] **Genomic-Specific Metric:** Implement a "Spurious Association Rate" test to measure if the models incorrectly learn the confounding ancestry signal instead of the true causal SNPs.
        
*   **2.3. Execute and Analyze Experiments:**
    
    *   - [ ] Run all selected algorithms on Universe A.
        
    *   - [ ] Run all selected algorithms on Universe B.
        
    *   - [ ] Systematically compare results, focusing on the failure modes in Universe B, especially the Spurious Association Rate.
        

**Phase 3: Real-World Data Corroboration**

*   **3.1. Prepare Real-World Dataset:**
    
    *   - [ ] Acquire and pre-process the 1000 Genomes Project dataset.5
        
    *   - [ ] Partition individuals into clients based on their annotated super-population (e.g., AFR, EUR, EAS) to create a realistic, highly heterogeneous federation.
        
*   **3.2. Design and Execute Proxy Task:**
    
    *   - [ ] Set up the task of predicting a client's super-population from their genotypes. This task is inherently confounded.
        
    *   - [ ] Run the best-performing standard FL algorithms from Phase 2 on this task.
        
    *   - [ ] Analyze and document the predicted failure to converge to a meaningful global model, providing real-world evidence for the thesis.
        

#### **Part II: FedGene Framework — Implementation and Validation (Months 9-24)**

**Objective:** To build, test, and validate the FedGene framework, demonstrating its superiority in performance, fairness, and efficiency for federated PRS prediction.

    *   - [ ] **Multi-Tiered Personalization Backend:**
        
        *   Implement Tier 1 (robust aggregation, e.g., FedProx).6
            
        *   Implement Tier 2 (architectural personalization, e.g., FedRep).6
            
        *   Implement Tier 3 (server-side hypernetwork that uses the Descriptor Vector to generate personalized model parameters).
            
    *   - [ ] **Dual-Update & Fairness Module:**
        
        *   Code the server-side logic to route gradients from personalized clients to update both the global model base and the hypernetwork.6
